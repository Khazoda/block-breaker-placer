# About üì¶

Basic Storage adds a single new item, the **Crate**.
This block can hold up to 1 billion items **of a single type**.
Items can be quickly deposited and withdrawn
- by directly interacting with crates (no GUI)
- by using hoppers/hopper carts
- by using third party mods (e.g. AE2, RS, Tom's Storage)

### Why use this mod?
Basic Storage is not the first mod to add blocks that function like crates.
This mod exists specifically to fulfil the following requirements:
- Simplified vanilla-esque design (no upgrades, no multiple crate types)
- Large storage size, low crafting cost (1 billion items, made from planks and sticks)
- Low file size & performance footprint
- Up to date with modern Minecraft versions

If you'd prefer to use a similar mod with blocks that support item compacting, block locking, an upgrade system etc., then please scroll further down to the **Acknowledgments** section. Some similar mods are listed there.
  
# Recipe üî®
Crates can be made from any type of wooden planks, as well as sticks.

# Demonstration üìΩÔ∏è
Crates save you time by giving you easy access to all of your materials.

# Acknowledgements üíå
Basic Storage wouldn't exist without the hard work and creativity of those that came before it. I'd like to give special thanks to the talented developers and artists behind JABBA, Storage Drawers and Extended Drawers, as well as every other barrel/drawer mod that came before them.

__Thank you to all the wonderful translation contributors!__
