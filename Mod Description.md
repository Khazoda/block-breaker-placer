# About ü™®

_Block Breaker & Block Placer_ adds two new blocks.  
Similarly to vanilla's Dispenser and Dropper, the Breaker and Placer are activated with a redstone pulse.
- The Breaker breaks the block in front of it and places it in its inventory.
- The Placer places a random block from its inventory in the spot in front of it.

### Why use this mod?
If you've ever wishes that you could turn items into placed blocks, or vise-versa, this mod is for you.  
Here are just some of the many applications:
- Automated cobblestone generators
- Secret entrances without using pistons
- New redstone contraptions (redstone torch inside a Placer?)
- Automatic cocoa bean farm
  
# Recipes üî®
The recipes for both blocks follow similar patterns to the dropper and dispenser:
